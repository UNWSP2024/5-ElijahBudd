# Program #1: Kilometer Converter
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers,
# then converts that distance to miles.  The conversion formula is as follows:
# Miles = kilometers x 0.6214.
# The conversion must be done as a function with input and output.


def kilometer_conversion(kilometers):
    miles = 0.0
    ######################
    miles = kilometers * 0.6214
    ######################

    # Return the variable to the calling function
    return miles

#### This piece of the code has been done for you,
#### you only need to worry about the actual kilometer
#### conversion logic in the kilometer_conversion function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Get User Input
    print('in main')
    kilometers = float(input("Enter distance in kilometers: "))
    # Call kilometer_conversion, don't forget to pass in the kilometer parameter!
    miles = kilometer_conversion(kilometers)
    # Display the miles
    print(f"In miles the distance is: {miles:.2f}")

Test Run:
in main
Enter distance in kilometers: 4.6
In miles the distance is: 2.86
